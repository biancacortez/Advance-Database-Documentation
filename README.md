# Database Documentation

## The database

This database is made to manage the data needed for a Student Portal System. At the moment, this database is consist of nine (9) entities and is responsible for users data management; creation, updation, & deletion management of user (students & authors) transactions and articles, although I am planning to include more features to this database system in the future. This database will be operated in a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) called MySQL. With that, multiple complex queries and methods to manage all of the relationships between entities will be used.

This database is an insource based on my plan to create a Student Portal Web Application in the future. The ERD shown in this documentation is made using Lucid Chart's general purpose diagram tool. The platform used to perform MySQL operations is PhpMyAdmin.
